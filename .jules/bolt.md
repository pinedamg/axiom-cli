## Memory Profiling & Optimization - [Date]

### 🧩 Data Structure Audit & Optimization
*   **DiscoveryEngine Collections**: Analyzed `src/engine/discovery.rs` and replaced `HashMap` with `BTreeMap` for string-keyed collections (`templates`, `synthesis_buffer`, `variable_buffer`). This mitigates the heavy hashing overhead for small, localized string keys and natively leverages sorting which we require downstream.
*   **Buffer Flushing**: During summary generation `flush_variable_summary`, implemented `std::mem::take` to extract keys out of `BTreeMap` buffers. This prevents `O(N log N)` allocation overhead from cloning and manually sorting keys that were necessary with HashMaps. Additionally, pre-allocated the resulting `summaries` vector based on known lengths using `Vec::with_capacity` to prevent multi-allocation scaling inside the hot-path loop.
*   **Regex Statically Compiled**: Optimized Regex initializations in `extract_parts` by statically caching compiled Regex instances using `std::sync::OnceLock`. This heavily alleviates cyclic heap allocations and CPU cycles executing `Regex::new()` on almost every line inside the parsing loop.
*   **Cow Allocations in Transform**: Addressed `apply_structural_transform` returning dynamically allocated heap `String` strings on every processed line by restructuring to return `std::borrow::Cow<str>`. This safely handles string references and guarantees actual heap allocations only occur precisely when Markdown transformation is requested.

**Impact**: Significant prevention of unnecessary heap allocation and cyclic overhead inside the per-line 'hot path'. Lowered hashing memory costs for system tracking.
